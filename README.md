# Fluvoxamine-Voriconazole-Bupropion-DDI
Modeling of published clinical Fluvoxamine-Voriconazole-Bupropion DDI study for model evaluation

## Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute a PK-Sim project file containing simulations of a published clinical study used to evaluate the predictive performance of the bupropion model regarding the fluvoxamine-voriconazole-bupropion-DDI, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports. The applied fluvoxamine and voriconazole models have been published previously [[1](https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/psp4.12397),[2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs40262-019-00856-z)]. For further details and documentation please refer to [[3](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/13/3/331)].

## Version information

PK-Sim Version 9.1.
